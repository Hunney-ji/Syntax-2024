# Three.js + Rapier in React
This project integrates Three.js for 3D graphics and Rapier for physics simulation within a React.js environment. It provides a basic setup to develop interactive 3D applications with realistic physics. You can use this template to build simulations, games, or any 3D application with physics-based interactions.

## Features
    Three.js for rendering 3D scenes.
    Rapier for real-time physics simulation, including collision detection and rigid body dynamics.
    React Three Fiber (R3F) integration to use Three.js in a React-friendly way.
    Modular architecture for extending and customizing your project.
